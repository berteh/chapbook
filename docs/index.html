<p><em>by Chris Klimas</em></p>
<p>Chapbook is a story format for Twine 2, which means that it plays stories created in Twine in a web browser. It is now part of the official Twine 2 distribution, but you may also use it from this URL:</p>
<p><code>https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/use/1.1.0/format.js</code></p>
<p>There is also a micro build of Chapbook that strips out all debugging-related code, saving around 20 kilobytes of JavaScript, that is not packaged with Twine 2. To use that version, add this story format:</p>
<p><code>https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/use/1.1.0-micro/format.js</code></p>
<p>Chapbook is released under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>. It can be used to create commercial works without royalty payment or other arrangement.</p>

<p>Want a quick look at the output Chapbook produces, or the way you write a code for it? Take a look at the <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.html">story</a> and its <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.txt">Twee source code</a>. If you&#39;ve never used Twee before, it&#39;s a compact text-only format for Twine stories. The main thing to keep in mind is that each line beginning with <code>::</code> describes a new passage.</p>
